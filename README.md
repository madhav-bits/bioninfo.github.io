### Abstract:
Prediction of protein secondary structure from the amino acid sequence is a classical bioinformatics problem.
Common methods use feed forward neural networks or SVM’s combined with a sliding window, as these models
does not naturally handle sequential data. Recurrent neural networks are an generalization of the feed forward
neural network that naturally handle sequential data. We use a bidirectional recurrent neural network with long
short term memory cells for prediction of secondary structure and evaluate using the Protein Data Bank dataset.


### Plan of action:
Understanding the paper and do some background work on implementing Neural Networks.\
Primary amino acids sequences of proteins would be collected from Protein Data Bank, WWPDB.\
Implement the Neural Network with Long Short Term cells.\
Train the neural network using Primary sequences.\
The model is evaluted based on the Q8 class ouput predictions.

### Work load:
The work load will be divided among the three of us equally in all aspects like reading research papers and Implementation.
